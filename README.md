## Overview

### Purpose
The "Highway Dodge Game" is an engaging arcade-style driving game designed to showcase the application of Python programming skills and the `pygame` library. The project emphasizes key development practices such as real-time input handling, collision detection, and dynamic content rendering. Its development served as a practical learning exercise in understanding complex game development concepts, including game loops, object-oriented programming, and interactive multimedia content management.

### Gameplay Mechanics
"Highway Dodge Game" offers a fast-paced driving experience where players navigate a car through a bustling highway filled with various obstacles. Players control the car using simple keyboard commands to dodge other vehicles and avoid collisions. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cars and trucks that vary in speed and frequency, challenging players to remain vigilant.
- **Power-Ups**: Collectible shields grant temporary invincibility, allowing players to survive otherwise lethal situations.
- **Scoring System**: Distance traveled is converted into points, rewarding players for their endurance and maneuvering skills.
- **Car Selection**: Before gameplay, players choose their vehicle, adding a personalized touch to the gaming experience.
- **Progression**: The game's difficulty incrementally increases as the player progresses, with obstacles becoming more frequent.
- **End-Game Condition**: The game ends when the player collides with an obstacle without a shield active. The final score is based on the distance traveled before the crash.
