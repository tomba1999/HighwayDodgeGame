## Overview

### Purpose
The "Highway Dodge Game" is an engaging arcade-style driving game designed to showcase the application of Python programming skills and the `pygame` library. The project emphasizes key development practices such as real-time input handling, collision detection, and dynamic content rendering. Its development served as a practical learning exercise in understanding complex game development concepts, including game loops, object-oriented programming, and interactive multimedia content management.

### Gameplay Mechanics
"Highway Dodge Game" offers a fast-paced driving experience where players navigate a car through a bustling highway filled with various obstacles. Players control the car using simple keyboard commands to dodge other vehicles and avoid collisions. Key features include:

- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cars and trucks that vary in speed and frequency, challenging players to remain vigilant.
- **Power-Ups**: Collectible shields grant temporary invincibility, allowing players to survive otherwise lethal situations.
- **Scoring System**: Distance traveled is converted into points, rewarding players for their endurance and maneuvering skills.
- **Car Selection**: Before gameplay, players choose their vehicle, adding a personalized touch to the gaming experience.

The game progresses in difficulty as the distance increases, introducing faster vehicles and more frequent obstacles to challenge the player's reaction time and strategic thinking.
